Developers and users should [read the documentation available in the wiki](https://github.com/WesterfieldCRL/CRG-browser/wiki) before creating a pull request or opening an issue.

CoRGi is free for anyone to use. It is developed by undergraduate students in Baylor University's Department of Computer Science. We do not receive compensation for our work, but we love to hear questions, comments, and concerns!
